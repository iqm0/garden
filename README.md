## A Flexible Approach for Growth in Software Development

Welcome to **Garden**, the _flexible framework for software development teams_ who value flexibility, collaboration, and the human element in their projects. **Garden** is a manifesto, an idea, a methodology designed to break free from the rigid confines of traditional software development practices, offering a breath of fresh air to small teams everywhere.

### Our Philosophy

In a world dominated by inflexible methodologies and prescriptive practices, Garden stands out by championing the principles of flexibility, individuality, and simplicity. Born from real-world frustrations and the insights of a lone developer in a moment of clarity, Garden is more than just a methodology; it's a call to rethink how we approach software development.

### Core Principles

- **Flexibility Over Rigidity**: Every team is unique, and so should be their approach to managing projects. Garden adapts to you, not the other way around.
- **Individuals and Interactions**: We put people first, emphasizing the well-being and growth of team members, recognizing that satisfied people deliver exceptional work.
- **Practicality and Adaptability**: Embracing change and learning from both successes and failures are at the heart of Garden, ensuring continuous improvement.
- **Simplicity in Execution**: In an increasingly complex world, simplicity remains our north star, making work enjoyable and productive.

### The Garden Framework

At its core, Garden is about understanding and adapting to the dynamics of small teams, providing a flexible framework that can be tailored to any project or team's needs.

### Key Components

- **North Star Initiatives**: Single, overarching goals that guide the team's efforts, focusing on what truly matters.
- **Three-Scenario Planning**: Tasks are approached with a mindset that considers the best, worst, and most likely scenarios, ensuring a balanced view of potential outcomes.
- **Task Vitality Tracking**: Visual indicators in the UI - such as the health of a plant ðŸŒ± -, should reflect the progress and urgency of tasks, adding a layer of engagement and intuition to project management.
- **Collaborative Decision-Making**: By striking a balance between the collective insights of the team and the clarity of purposeful leadership, we ensure that our direction is both inclusive and focused, harnessing the power of diverse perspectives while maintaining a clear sense of purpose.
- **Transparency and Learning**: Successes and failures are shared openly, not just within the team but across the organization, amplifying learning opportunities.

### Getting Started

Garden is currently a manifesto and methodology that can be applied within existing project management tools. While we envision integrating Garden into a dedicated productivity board, we encourage teams to adopt and adapt these principles within their current frameworks. We also intend to build our own version of such a tool, and share here with you in a while from now (as soon as I have time away from sprints ðŸ˜¬).

### How to Use Garden

- **Read the Manifesto**: Familiarize yourself with the core principles and components of Garden.
- **Implement Gradually**: Start with one or two components that resonate most with your team's needs and gradually integrate more as you see fit.
- **Share Your Experiences**: We believe in learning from the community. Share your successes, challenges, and insights, and let's grow together.

### Contributing to Garden

**Garden** is an open-source idea, and we welcome contributions from the community. Whether it's feedback, suggestions, or your own experiences with implementing **Garden**, your input is invaluable in evolving this framework.

**Join us** in redefining software development for small teams, making it more humane, flexible, and effective.
